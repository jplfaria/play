# Ontology Analysis of Microbial Phenotype Datasets (Enhanced Summary)

## Executive Overview
Four microbial phenotype datasets were analyzed to determine optimal ontology coverage. Current general ontologies (PATO, CHEBI, ENVO, ECO) provide fragmented coverage (~30-40% for complete phenotype statements). Specialized microbial ontologies (OMP for phenotypes, MCO for conditions) combined with ECO for evidence would increase coverage to >95% while ensuring reproducibility and interoperability.

### Data Structure Summary
- **Type:** Transposon mutagenesis fitness screening
- **Content:** Three sheets containing gene-fitness matrix (100 genes × 106 conditions), experiment metadata (quality metrics, correlations), and raw barcode count data
- **Format:** Numeric fitness scores (log2 ratios) indicating growth defects under various conditions
- **Conditions:** 35 carbon sources (sugars, acids, alcohols), 13 nitrogen sources (amino acids, dipeptides), and control media (LB, M9, MOPS)

### Microbial Data Analysis
- **Phenotypes:** Gene knockout fitness defects revealing metabolic dependencies
- **Key patterns:** 
  - Threonine operon genes show strong negative fitness in minimal media (amino acid biosynthesis)
  - Galacturonate metabolism genes specifically fail on D-galacturonic acid
  - Housekeeping genes show neutral fitness across most conditions
- **Data quality:** High-throughput quantitative data with replicates; typically binarized for interpretation (fitness < -2 = growth defect)

### Current Ontology Assessment
- **PATO:** ~50% coverage - provides growth magnitude terms (decreased/abolished) but lacks context
- **Required combinations:**
  - CHEBI for substrates (e.g., CHEBI:17234 for glucose)
  - ENVO/OBI for media descriptions
  - ECO for evidence (ECO:0007032 - transposon mutagenesis evidence)
  - NCBITaxon for strain identification
  - GO for linking to metabolic processes
- **Limitations:** Complex multi-ontology annotations needed for each phenotype

### Specialized Microbial Ontology Comparison
- **OMP Assessment:**
  - Coverage: >90% with pre-coordinated terms like "unable to grow on galacturonate"
  - Advantages: Single terms capture full phenotype context, hierarchical organization
  - Examples: OMP:0007234 (galacturonate utilization defect), auxotrophy terms
  - **Recommendation: Add OMP (10/10)**

- **MCO Assessment:**
  - Coverage: Standardizes all growth conditions (M9 + glucose, LB, etc.)
  - Advantages: Eliminates free-text ambiguity, enables cross-dataset comparison
  - Examples: MCO terms for "M9 minimal medium with 0.2% glucose"
  - **Recommendation: Add MCO (9/10)**

### Implementation with ECO
- Transform fitness scores to phenotype calls with documented thresholds:
  ```
  Phenotype: OMP:0007234 (unable to grow on galacturonate)
  Evidence: ECO:0007032 (transposon mutagenesis)
  Details: fitness = -4.5, p < 0.001, 15,234 barcode reads
  Threshold: ECO:0000033 documenting "fitness < -2 = defect"
  ```

### Data Structure Summary
- **Type:** Chemical genomics screen (Nichols et al. 2011)
- **Content:** ~3,979 Keio mutants × 324 stress conditions
- **Format:** Colony size measurements (S-scores) with statistical significance
- **Conditions:** Antibiotics (>50 types), temperature stress (16-45°C), oxidative stress, metal toxicity, pH stress, membrane disruption

### Microbial Data Analysis
- **Phenotype categories:**
  - Antibiotic sensitivity (e.g., mecillinam → cell wall defects)
  - Stress tolerance (heat shock, oxidative damage)
  - Multi-stress resistance genes (affecting multiple conditions)
  - Auxotrophy (revealed by nutrient omission)
- **Functional groupings:** Genes cluster by pathway (e.g., nuo operon mutants share phenotype patterns)

### Current Ontology Assessment
- **PATO:** ~40-50% coverage - general sensitivity/resistance terms
- **Complex requirements:**
  - CHEBI for all compounds (near 100% coverage for chemicals)
  - ECO:0001563 (colony size measurement evidence)
  - ECO:0007634 (chemical genetic interaction evidence)
  - UO for concentrations
  - Multiple relations (RO) to link components
- **Major gap:** No unified way to describe "antibiotic sensitivity phenotype"

### Specialized Microbial Ontology Comparison
- **OMP Assessment:**
  - Direct terms for antibiotic resistance/sensitivity by class
  - Temperature-sensitive growth phenotypes
  - Stress response categories pre-defined
  - **Recommendation: Strongly add OMP (10/10)**

- **MCO Assessment:**
  - Handles complex conditions: "LB + 1.5M NaCl" or "M9 - leucine"
  - Incorporates concentration, temperature, pH systematically
  - Many E. coli conditions already curated from RegulonDB
  - **Recommendation: Add MCO (9/10)**

### ECO Integration Critical
- Primary: ECO:0001563 (colony size measurement)
- Statistical: S-scores, p-values, FDR thresholds
- Normalization: Plate effects, systematic corrections
- Complete annotation example:
  ```
  Mutant: ΔrecA
  Phenotype: OMP:0006098 (increased antibiotic susceptibility)
  Condition: MCO:[mecillinam 10μg/mL in LB]
  Evidence: ECO:0001563, S-score = -3.2, FDR < 0.05
  ```

- **Content:** 48 environmental E. coli isolates × 29 carbon sources
- **Format:** Binary growth matrix (1 = growth, 0 = no growth)
- **Processing:** Raw OD measurements (Sheets 3-4) converted to binary calls using max/min thresholds

### Microbial Data Analysis
- **Substrate categories tested:**
  - Simple sugars: glucose, fructose, maltose
  - Complex sugars: raffinose, cellobiose, stachyose
  - Sugar alcohols: mannitol, sorbitol, arabitol
  - Organic acids: malate, succinate, lactate
  - Specialized: sialic acid (N-acetyl neuraminic acid)
- **Patterns:** Isolates show diverse utilization profiles suggesting niche adaptations

### Current Ontology Assessment
- **PATO:** ~50% - binary presence/absence well-covered
- **CHEBI:** Excellent substrate coverage
- **Missing:** Unified "carbon source utilization" concept
- **ECO needs:**
  - ECO:0001091 (phenotype microarray evidence) if Biolog used
  - ECO:0000033 for threshold documentation
  - Critical: Document how binary calls were made

### Specialized Microbial Ontology Comparison
- **OMP Assessment:**
  - Perfect fit: "(in)ability to utilize X as carbon source" terms
  - Hierarchical: Groups all carbon phenotypes together
  - Handles partial utilization if needed later
  - **Recommendation: Add OMP (10/10)**

- **MCO Assessment:**
  - Ensures "glucose carbon source" consistent across datasets
  - Encodes "sole carbon source" context explicitly
  - **Recommendation: Add MCO (9/10)**

### ECO Documentation Essential
```
Evidence: ECO:0001091 (phenotype microarray)
Threshold: ECO:0000033 "Growth if OD600 > 0.2 at 24h"
Normalization: "Max/min per substrate across isolates"
```
