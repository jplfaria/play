# Ontology Analysis of Microbial Phenotype Datasets

## File: RBTnSeq-BW25113_sample.xlsx

### Data Structure Summary

- **Sheets & Purpose:** The workbook contains three sheets: **BW25113** (main data matrix), **exp-meta** (experiment metadata), and **Sheet3** (raw barcode data). The BW25113 sheet lists E. coli BW25113 genes (by locusId and gene name) with numeric phenotype values across many conditions. The exp-meta sheet provides descriptions for each experiment (condition name, media, etc.), and Sheet3 appears to contain raw transposon insertion counts per barcode.

- **Key Columns:** In the BW25113 sheet, each row is a gene (columns for locusId, sysName (gene symbol), and desc (gene description)). Subsequent columns represent different growth conditions or timepoints. Column headers are experiment identifiers (e.g. set1IT003) along with a short description like *"D-Glucose (C)"* or *"LB"*. These denote the specific substrates or media used (e.g. D-Glucose as Carbon source, LB medium).

- **Data Types & Patterns:** The phenotype values are numerical (likely fitness scores or log2 fold changes in mutant abundance). For example, negative values indicate a growth defect for that mutant in the given condition, whereas values near zero indicate neutral effect. The exp-meta sheet shows metadata per condition (e.g. each set1ITxxx entry has fields for mapped reads, correlation, etc.), confirming these are results of a high-throughput fitness assay (random barcoded transposon sequencing). Sheet3 is a detailed table of transposon barcodes mapped to loci, with read count metrics per condition, underpinning the summarized gene fitness in the main sheet.

- **Cross-Isolate Trends:** We can infer some relationships: If two isolates have very similar patterns of 1/0 across 29 substrates, they might be related or from similar niches. If one isolate is missing multiple capabilities (e.g. isolate with many zeros might be a more specialized strain), that could indicate an evolutionary trade-off (loss of functions in exchange for something else). Also, the set of substrates not utilized by a strain can indicate gene absence: e.g. an isolate that is 0 for all Î²-glucosides (salicin, cellobiose, arbutin if tested) likely lacks the bgl genes. This dataset could thus be used to correlate genotype (from genome sequencing) with phenotype via presence/absence of pathways.

### Current Ontology Assessment

1. **Best Available Ontology:** **PATO (Phenotypic Quality Ontology)** -- *Coverage:* ~50%. The phenotypes here are essentially binary outcomes of growth, which PATO can describe in terms of qualities: *presence* or *absence* of growth on a substrate. PATO has terms like "presence of process" or can use "increased/decreased" in a qualitative sense. *Strengths:* PATO provides a standardized way to say something is present or absent. For instance, we could denote "growth on X present" vs "growth on X absent" using a PATO quality (perhaps "abolished" for absent, "normal" for present if we treat the expected as can grow). It also has "ability" vs "inability" if phrased as qualities (though those might be more in OMP's domain than PATO's literal terms). The simplicity of the phenotype (yes/no growth) means PATO's binary qualities actually suffice for the core observation. *Limitations:* PATO by itself doesn't name the substrate or the context, so we again have to pair it with an entity. The entity here would be something like "utilization of compound X" or "growth on X as carbon source". There's no single ontology in the available set that has classes for "utilize salicin" except perhaps we could treat it as a process from GO (e.g. GO:0046218 salicin catabolic process). But GO is about the biological process, not directly about the phenotype of growth on that substrate. We might end up creating an ad hoc term like "growth on salicin" as an entity (maybe using OBI or ENVO to say "culturing on salicin"). Another limitation is nuance: PATO can say absent vs present, but in our data some growth could be slower (which is not captured since we binarized it). If that detail mattered, PATO would need "decreased growth" vs "normal growth" distinctions. Without a microbial phenotype ontology, we'd have to manually define each "growth on [substrate]" scenario using a combination.

   *Example Mappings:* For isolate 562.61239 which has 0 on D-Fructose, we'd annotate something like: *"Ability to grow on D-fructose" = false*. In PATO terms, possibly *"absent growth on fructose"*. If an isolate can grow on salicin (1), we'd say *"growth on salicin present (normal)"*. PATO might not have an explicit "present" term (often it's implied by lack of abnormality), but one could use "has growth" vs "lacks growth". We might encode this with a PATO term for "viable" or "growth achieved" if available, but likely it's easier to say the phenotype is the absence of growth when 0, and no phenotype when 1 (meaning wild-type expectation of growth). This again shows PATO's limited direct vocabulary for this -- it frames things as qualities that usually need an entity like *growth*.

2. **Complementary Ontologies Needed:** Several ontologies from our list would be needed in tandem:

   - **CHEBI:** All substrates (salicin, raffinose, lactose, etc.) are chemical compounds or mixtures. CHEBI has entries for virtually all of these (including complex ones like pectin, which CHEBI does cover as a generic polymer). We would use CHEBI IDs to identify the compounds. For example, CHEBI:17592 for salicin, CHEBI:17992 for raffinose, CHEBI:17716 for lactose, etc. If we frame the phenotype as "growth on X", we need X from CHEBI.

   - **ECO:** For binary phenotype data, ECO is essential to document how binary calls were made. Relevant terms include:
     - ECO:0005025 (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay evidence) - if ELISA-based detection was used
     - ECO:0001091 (phenotype microarray evidence) - if Biolog PM was used
     - ECO:0005007 (reporter gene assay evidence) - if metabolic indicators were used
     - ECO:0000033 (author statement) - for documenting threshold criteria
     
     Critical for this dataset: ECO can capture the threshold methodology seen in Sheet3/4:
     - How max/min values were used to set cutoffs
     - What constitutes "growth" vs "no growth" (OD threshold? Time point?)
     - Whether replicates were performed
     - The normalization approach applied

   - **ENVO / OBI:** To talk about "growth on X as sole carbon source", we might use ENVO's environmental material or OBI's assay concepts. ENVO has terms for culture media components and possibly could represent something like *"minimal medium with carbon source X"*. If not, OBI might have terms like *"growth phenotype assay on substrate"*. Since this file is essentially results of (most likely) Biolog Phenotypic MicroArray or similar tests, OBI actually has terms for Biolog plate assays. If each substrate corresponds to a well in a Biolog PM plate, one could use OBI: "Biolog PM test for carbon source utilization" as an assay term. But for outcome annotation, we'd still need to describe the result.

   - **NCBITaxon:** This will tag each isolate to *E. coli* (and possibly strain-level if we had identifiers). Since all share species, at least linking to NCBITaxon:562 (E. coli) is necessary, and if those "Genome ID" numbers correspond to entries, we might link those to a strain registry or BioSample ontology. In absence of a specific strain ontology, we can treat them as instances in our database.

   - **GO / MetaCyc:** These can provide functional context. For each substrate, there is a corresponding metabolic process: e.g. "salicin catabolic process" (if existent in GO) or "raffinose utilization pathway" (MetaCyc has RAFFINOSOMONOSIDES pathway, etc.). We could annotate that *Isolate A lacks growth on substrate Y* and correlate that to *Isolate A lacks enzyme Z (from genome analysis)* which is part of GO pathway for Y. While not directly asked for in annotation, for integration purposes linking phenotypes to known metabolic pathways via GO or MetaCyc terms can be valuable. E.g., no growth on sorbitol implies something about the *srl* operon; GO term "sorbitol catabolic process" could be linked to that phenotype to facilitate gene-phenotype connections.

   - **PCO:** If needed, PCO could describe that these are population-level growth phenotypes of clonal isolates. But since we're dealing with pure cultures, this might be overkill. PCO might be more relevant if comparing communities, which we are not here.

   - **SEED/ModelSEED:** These in-house ontologies classify metabolic capabilities and could be used to fill gaps. For example, SEED has subsystems like "Fermentation of Sugars" and groups organisms by what they ferment. We could map each substrate to a subsystem (like "Sugars -- Raffinose Family" for raffinose/stachyose, "Sugar Alcohols" for sorbitol/arabitol). This can complement the ontological annotation by offering a higher-level grouping in analysis. It's not so much used in annotation but in making sense of patterns or suggesting terms.

   - **Coverage Consideration:** With CHEBI and a notion of growth, we can cover each data point ("growth on CHEBI:X yes/no"). But we might want a term for "utilization of carbon source" to serve as the entity whose quality we describe. If none in available ontologies, we'd have to define one or borrow from MicrO ontology (not listed, but MicrO is an ontology of microbial properties that might have "ability to utilize carbon source" terms). Without OMP, we lack a straightforward single term like "salicin utilization phenotype", hence the combination approach is required.

   - **Summary:** Current ontologies allow us to identify all the *substrates* unambiguously and to describe the *growth outcome qualitatively*. They do not, however, have ready-made classes for each substrate utilization phenotype. So we'd be effectively constructing 29 phenotype definitions (one per substrate) along the lines of "ability to metabolize X -- present/absent". This is exactly the kind of work a microbial phenotype ontology like OMP or a trait ontology would simplify.

### Specialized Microbial Ontology Comparison

1. **OMP (Ontology of Microbial Phenotypes) Assessment:**

   - **Coverage of Traits:** OMP has a dedicated branch for metabolic phenotypes, including carbon source utilization. It would greatly increase coverage by providing terms or term frameworks for each substrate utilization. OMP defines phenotypes like *"able to utilize X as carbon source"* and *"unable to utilize X as carbon source"* (often structured as children of "carbon source utilization phenotype"). If a specific compound isn't already in OMP, OMP's structure allows linking an existing generic term to a specific CHEBI term as needed. For example, OMP might have "carbohydrate utilization absent" and we could specify CHEBI: raffinose to indicate raffinose specifically, or OMP may have added common ones like "raffinose utilization absent" if curated.

   - **Advantages:** The big advantage is **pre-coordination and clarity**. Instead of treating each substrate as a one-off case, OMP provides a template: *OMP:0006110 (unable to utilize carbon source)* could be a term and each specific substrate would be a child or an instance of that pattern. In fact, OMP's logical definitions mean if we annotate properly, we get a hierarchy: e.g., all "X utilization absent" are types of "carbon utilization phenotype". This makes querying easier (find all carbon sources an isolate cannot use). With our current approach, we'd have to manually group by chemical class; OMP would inherently group them. OMP terms also often encapsulate the notion of growth on media with that compound as sole source, which is exactly what we need (no need to separately mention "sole carbon source", it's understood in the term's definition).

   - **Specific Examples:**
     - If OMP has a term **"unable to metabolize D-galacturonate"**, we'd directly use that for any isolate that scored 0 on D-Galacturonic Acid. If not present, we can request it; since OMP covers many E. coli phenotypes, it likely already has or can easily add it (perhaps as a subclass of "hexuronate utilization phenotype").
     - For something like **N-acetyl neuraminic acid (sialic acid)**, which is more niche, OMP might not have a term pre-made. But OMP does allow curators to annotate "utilization of sialic acid: positive/negative" by referencing CHEBI for sialic acid. The ontology maintainers can formalize it later. So OMP provides a consistent methodology to handle both common and uncommon substrates.
     - Another nuance: OMP can capture degrees of utilization. In our data it's binary, but if in another dataset an isolate partially utilizes something, OMP has terms like "decreased utilization" vs "normal utilization". This could be useful if later we include quantitative differences (though this dataset itself is binary).

   - **Recommendation:** **Yes, leverage OMP.** For a metabolic phenotype dataset like this, OMP is extremely well-suited. It systematically covers microbial metabolic traits, ensuring that each substrate utilization is annotated in a consistent, structured manner across isolates. Using OMP will also facilitate **cross-comparison** with other strain collections (for instance, if another study annotated E. coli or Salmonella carbon utilization in OMP, we could directly compare). *Confidence: 10/10* -- OMP will capture essentially all these phenotypes with minimal custom work, and it will integrate the data with broader microbial phenotype knowledge.

2. **MCO (Microbial Conditions Ontology) Assessment:**

   - **Coverage of Conditions:** In this dataset, "conditions" are basically different media where the sole varying component is the carbon source. MCO can represent these as distinct terms or as a combination of "minimal medium base + X as carbon source". Since this pattern is repetitive, MCO's value is in standardizing how we denote each medium. For example, an MCO term for *"M9 minimal medium with salicin as carbon source"* could be created. MCO already includes base media and many supplements; salicin might not be a standard supplement, but it's a chemical (would come via CHEBI). We could generate terms systematically if needed using MCO's framework.

   - **Advantages:** Although one might argue that listing CHEBI ID for the carbon source is enough, MCO provides context that it's *used as a carbon source in a growth medium*. This context is important -- the phenotype is not just exposure to chemical X, it's the ability to grow when X is the only carbon source. MCO would allow us to differentiate that scenario from, say, being tested as a nitrogen source or just being in the environment. It encodes the role of the compound in the experiment. Additionally, using MCO ensures that if the base medium or other conditions (like temperature) are relevant, those are included. Perhaps all tests were done at 37Â°C aerobic; if so, one could include that in the condition definition so it's implicit. MCO terms, because they are structured, would let us change one parameter (the carbon source) and reuse the rest of the description, rather than writing out a full description each time.

   - **Example Conditions with MCO:** If these tests were done with something like Biolog GN2 plates, the base is a defined minimal medium. MCO might have something like *"Biolog PM base medium"* as a term, and then each carbon source is an added variable. We could either create each as an individual term (which might be a lot, but manageable for 29 compounds), or use an annotation property approach (but likely easier to just have terms). For instance, "growth medium containing D-fructose as sole carbon source" as a term. MCO's design encourages combining basic terms, so it might not pre-list every carbon source medium, but we can compose it.

   - **Recommendation:** **Yes, include MCO.** While this dataset is simpler in context variety than the Nichols dataset, MCO still adds clarity and consistency. It ensures that "Glucose (C)" in one file and "Glucose carbon source" in another are recognized as the same concept. For integration, it's important that all datasets refer to conditions in a unified way. Using MCO for the carbon source media across datasets allows direct comparisons (e.g., the RB-TnSeq dataset also had D-Galacturonic Acid M9 -- with MCO we can link that condition to the same term used here). *Confidence: 9/10* -- MCO is highly relevant. The only consideration is the overhead of creating specific terms if they aren't pre-existing, but given the limited scope (29 media), that's a minor effort with a big payoff in consistency.

### Implementation Recommendations

- **Annotation Strategy with OMP/MCO/ECO:** We will assign an OMP phenotype term for each "0" in the matrix (i.e., each failure to grow). For each "1" (growth), we might not explicitly annotate "normal growth" unless we want to record positive abilities too -- which we probably do, to have a complete profile. OMP has terms for positive phenotypes as well (like "able to grow on X"). We should decide whether to capture both presence and absence. For integration and search, absence phenotypes (inability) are usually what's noted, but presence can be equally informative in a broader database. We could annotate both: e.g., *Isolate A has phenotype "able to utilize lactose" (OMP term)* and *Isolate B has "unable to utilize lactose"*. This yields a comprehensive dataset of abilities.

- **Data Transformation with ECO:** The binary conversion process (Sheets 3/4 â Sheet 2) must be documented with ECO:
  ```
  Evidence: ECO:0001091 (phenotype microarray evidence)
  Threshold_method: ECO:0000033 (author statement)
  Details: "Growth called if OD600 > 0.2 at 24h"
  Reference_range: "Based on max/min across all isolates"
  Normalization: "Background subtracted, plate effects corrected"
  ```

- **Data Management:** If we integrate these with strain genome data, each isolate's genome could be annotated with these phenotypes. Later, queries like "find all isolates that cannot use sorbitol" become trivial via the OMP term query. Without OMP, we'd be querying a column in a table by value, which is fine internally but not standardized externally. With OMP, our database could join the wider world of phenotype data -- e.g., linking to OMPwiki entries for those phenotypes.

- **Quality Control:** If some calls were borderline, OMP also has terms like "decreased growth on X" as opposed to complete absence, if needed. We might incorporate some of the measured data (from Sheets3/4) to decide if any "1" should actually be "partial growth" phenotype. OMP would allow that nuance. In absence of nuance, we stick to binary as given. ECO evidence codes help track confidence in borderline calls.

- **Cross-dataset integration:** Using OMP and MCO here sets the stage for merging this dataset's info with others. For example, if one of these isolates is BW25113 (just hypothetically), we could compare its profile to the RB-TnSeq results of BW25113 under the same condition. Or, if MG1655 (next dataset) is among these, we could check consistency. Having a unified ontology means MG1655's inability to use a compound in one dataset and BW25113's in another can be directly related (same OMP term).

- **Confidence & Future-proofing:** We are confident that adopting specialized ontologies here not only addresses current needs but also future use. If new substrates or more isolates are added, we simply continue with OMP/MCO. The cost is minor (look up or request new OMP terms occasionally, maintain ontology updates), and benefit is high (we won't have to refactor annotations later). The consistent use of OMP/MCO/ECO across all datasets will significantly ease **database queries, reporting, and logic for integration** (like finding correlations between genotype and phenotype).

## File: MG1655_Phenotype_Microarray_Table.xlsx

### Data Structure Summary

- **Sheets & Purpose:** This file contains results from a Phenotype MicroArray (PM) experiment on *E. coli* K-12 MG1655. It has three sheets (Sheet1, Sheet2, Sheet3) which seem to duplicate or slightly differ in formatting of the same content. Sheets2 and 3 show identical data for the first few rows (likely one is a cleaned version of the other). We'll focus on **Sheet2** which appears to be properly structured. Each row in Sheet2 corresponds to a specific well of a Biolog Phenotype MicroArray plate, and columns describe the test conditions and outcomes.

- **Key Columns:** The columns are: *Plate* (e.g. PM1, PM2, etc.), *Well/Position* (the alphanumeric well coordinate, e.g. A1, B3), *Compound Name* (the substrate or condition in that well), *Carbon Source* (a flag or descriptor, often "Yes" or "No"), and *Growth Status*. There's also an *Unnamed: 5* column which is mostly empty (likely an artifact of formatting or an unused second replicate column). For example:
  - Plate PM1 (Carbon sources 1) -- Well A1 is "Negative Control" with Carbon Source "Yes" (meaning this plate tests carbon, so negative control has no carbon) and Growth Status "No Growth" (MG1655 did not grow with no carbon, as expected).
  - Plate PM1 -- Well A2 "L-Arabinose" -- Carbon Source "Yes" -- Growth Status "No Growth" (indicating MG1655 did not show growth on L-arabinose in this test).
  - Plate PM1 -- Well A3 "N-Acetyl-D-Glucosamine" -- Carbon Source "Yes" -- Growth Status "Low Growth" (some weak growth observed).
  - ... and so on.

  The *Carbon Source* column values are mostly "Yes" or "No", signaling whether the well's test compound is a carbon source. However, for plates that test other nutrient types, this column seems to contain different values (in our data snippet, some entries were garbled like "L-Î±-Glycerol-Phosphate" under Carbon Source). This suggests that for non-carbon plates (like nitrogen source tests on PM3 or phosphorus/sulfur on PM4), the column might list the fixed carbon source used in those wells or an alternate label. It's likely a misalignment in the raw data reading. But logically:
  - For PM1/PM2 (carbon source plates): Carbon Source = "Yes" for all wells where a carbon source is being tested (and perhaps "Yes" even for control as a category indicator).
  - For PM3 (nitrogen sources): Carbon Source would be "No" (because those wells provide nitrogen while carbon is supplied by something else, e.g. a base carbon source like glycerol-phosphate -- which might be why we see that text).
  - For PM4 (sulfur/phosphorus): similarly Carbon Source "No" since the compounds are not carbon sources.

  In other words, "Carbon Source" column is a bit overloaded; it acts as a categorical indicator for the type of nutrient being tested in that well.

- **Data Types & Patterns:** The Growth Status is qualitative with values like "No Growth", "Low Growth", "Growth" (possibly also "High Growth" or intermediate categories depending on convention). This indicates the outcome of MG1655 in each well relative to some threshold or reference. "Low Growth" likely means significantly less growth/turbidity than a positive control, but not zero; "Growth" means substantial growth comparable to positive control. The presence of exact duplicates in multiple sheets might mean one sheet had an issue with column alignment (Sheet1 looks like columns got shifted, whereas Sheet2 is correct). There are 336 rows, which corresponds to 3.5 microplates of data. Possibly the experiment included:
  - PM1 (Carbon sources 1, 95 wells + control)
  - PM2 (Carbon sources 2, 95 wells + control) -- that's ~192 wells total so far.
  - PM3 (Nitrogen sources, 95 wells + control) -- ~288 total.
  - PM4 (Phosphorus & Sulfur sources, 95 wells + control) -- would be 384 if fully done. We have 336, which suggests not all of PM4 or not done? It could be that PM4 was partially filled or some wells not applicable. Alternatively, perhaps they did 3 plates and a portion of a 4th (some PM4 wells, or a custom plate).

  In any case, the data covers multiple nutrient categories, each plate's context affecting how to interpret the "Carbon Source" column. We should treat the Growth Status as the key result per condition.

### Microbial Data Analysis

- **Phenotype Types:** The phenotypes here are **nutrient utilization capabilities and related growth outcomes** of the strain MG1655:
  - **Carbon source utilization:** PM1 and PM2 test a wide range of carbon sources (sugars, sugar alcohols, acids, etc.) for the ability to support growth. MG1655's results show which carbon sources it can use fully ("Growth"), which it cannot ("No Growth"), and which it can only weakly use ("Low Growth"). For example, MG1655 shows "No Growth" on L-arabinose in this data (which is interesting, as many E. coli can use arabinose -- possibly MG1655 has a slow phenotype without induction, or the result indicates an issue). It shows "Growth" on succinic acid and others, indicating good utilization.
  - **Nitrogen source utilization:** PM3 includes various nitrogen sources (amino acids, nucleotides, etc. as sole N source with a fixed carbon present). The growth status there tells us which N sources MG1655 can use. We saw some clues of compounds listed in the Carbon Source column for PM3 (like L-Î±-Amino-N-butyric acid, etc.), which are likely specific N sources where MG1655 might have varied growth.
  - **Phosphorus/Sulfur source utilization:** PM4 typically has different P sources (like glycerol-3-phosphate, phosphonate compounds) and S sources (like sulfonates, L-cysteine vs sulfate, etc.). MG1655's growth on those indicates how flexible it is in sourcing P and S. The snippet revealed compounds such as L-Methionine, L-Ethionine, L-Lipoamide in the Carbon Source column -- those are likely sulfur sources (methionine as an organic sulfur source, etc.). Their presence implies MG1655 might have differential growth depending on those sources (e.g. can it use L-methionine as sole sulfur? Many E. coli can by deamination to methanethiol, etc., but not all strains efficiently).
  - **Negative control:** Each plate has a negative control (no carbon in PM1/2, no nitrogen in PM3, etc.), MG1655 unsurprisingly has "No Growth" there (which serves as a baseline check).
  - MG1655 being a well-studied lab strain, these phenotypes serve as a baseline "wild-type" reference for E. coli metabolism. Any "No Growth" indicates a known inability (e.g. E. coli K-12 is famously unable to use certain compounds like adipate, D-amino acids, etc.), while "Growth" indicates expected metabolic competence.

- **Environmental Conditions & Substrates:** This dataset explicitly lists each compound tested:
  - Carbon sources include sugars (arabinose, glucose, lactose, etc.), sugar derivatives (N-acetylglucosamine, D-saccharic acid a.k.a. D-glucarate, etc.), carboxylic acids (succinic acid, acetoacetic acid), and so on.
  - Nitrogen sources include amino acids (perhaps L-alanine, L-asparagine, etc.), nitrogenous bases or compounds (e.g. adenine, or nitrate/nitrite might appear).
  - P/S sources include inorganic and organic sources (phosphate, phosphonate, taurine, cysteine, methionine, etc.).
  
  Each is a distinct condition wherein MG1655 must grow if it can assimilate that source. Additionally, "Carbon Source: Yes/No" effectively flags whether the primary variable is a carbon source or not, which changes the medium composition (if "No", carbon was supplied by something common to all wells of that plate).
  - Temperature, inoculum, incubation time are presumably constant across all these tests (likely 37Â°C, aerobic).

- **Data Patterns:** MG1655 is a prototrophic strain (can synthesize all its amino acids and vitamins), so on nitrogen plates, it should grow on many amino acids as N source by deaminating them. It might not grow on some unusual ones (e.g. it might not utilize creatine or certain cyclic compounds). On carbon plates, MG1655 can utilize many sugars (glucose, fructose, etc.), but often K-12 cannot use some compounds without mutations (e.g. it typically cannot use succinate effectively unless the media is adapted -- though in PM it might if given enough time; the data says "Growth" on succinic acid, meaning it can).

  We see a "Low Growth" on N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc), maybe MG1655 grows slowly on GlcNAc (which is somewhat surprising; it can use GlcNAc normally via the nag pathway -- perhaps it's a borderline call).

  The data showing "No Growth" on L-arabinose was unexpected (MG1655 should have a functional araBAD operon). It could be experimental (maybe MG1655 requires induction by prior arabinose exposure to grow well on arabinose, or there's an issue). "Low Growth" might mean slight growth but below threshold. This illustrates that some results might need interpretation -- "No Growth" doesn't always mean genetic incapability; it could be regulatory or experimental artifact.

- **Data Quality:** Being a single strain tested with a standardized method (Biolog plates), the data quality is fairly high in consistency. Each well's reading was likely compared to control and categorized. Some calls like "Low Growth" indicate intermediate cases that the algorithm flagged as not full growth but above background. The qualitative nature (High/Low) mitigates small errors, but a few wells could be miscategorized (especially if MG1655 is known to grow on arabinose, one might suspect it was slightly under threshold). However, that's one data point out of many; overall the dataset is reliable for indicating presence/absence of growth on given nutrients.

- **Taxonomic Info:** Only *E. coli* strain MG1655 is involved here. This is effectively a phenotypic fingerprint of that strain. In databases, MG1655 is a reference strain; these results could serve as reference phenotypes for E. coli K-12. No other strains or species are present in this file.

### Current Ontology Assessment

1. **Best Available Ontology:** **PATO (Phenotypic Quality Ontology)** -- *Coverage:* ~60%. PATO can capture the qualitative outcomes ("no growth", "low growth", "growth") as phenotypic qualities of the growth process. *Strengths:* It provides a controlled vocabulary for terms like "absent" vs "present" vs "reduced" which correspond to No Growth, Growth, and Low Growth respectively. If we interpret "Low Growth" as "decreased growth compared to normal", that aligns with a PATO term for "decreased intensity" or "reduced rate" etc. "No Growth" is essentially "absent process". PATO's neutrality to context means we can reuse the same few quality terms for all substrates (just attached to different conditions). *Limitations:* Alone, PATO doesn't specify which substrate or condition the phenotype pertains to. We would need to pair it with an entity representing "growth on compound X". Also, PATO doesn't define what counts as "low" vs "normal" -- that threshold is experimental. We might have to interpret "Low Growth" as qualitatively "partial growth" but PATO might not have a direct term called "partial"; we might use "decreased growth" for that. Another limitation is that PATO can't group or differentiate why growth is low -- it's just a measurement outcome. In terms of coverage, PATO covers the *notion* of growth presence/absence but we rely on other ontologies to cover the *substance and condition*.

   *Example Mappings:*
   - Negative Control well: MG1655 had "No Growth". We'd annotate as *growth (process) has quality PATO:0000462 (absent)* in the context "no carbon source" (which we have to attach via condition).
   - Succinic Acid well: "Growth" -- we interpret that as normal growth, so no abnormal phenotype. We might not create an annotation for normal outcome unless we want to explicitly say "growth present" (some use a term like PATO:0000467 'presence of process' or simply consider absence of a negative phenotype as implicit).
   - N-Acetylglucosamine: "Low Growth" -- we'd say *growth has quality PATO:0002051 (decreased rate or extent)* in presence of GlcNAc.
   
   These would require linking to the compound (CHEBI) or condition (maybe an ENVO term for "medium with X").

2. **Complementary Ontologies Needed:**

   - **CHEBI:** for each compound tested. All substrates (and even some negative controls like "no carbon" could be implicitly CHEBI:11529 (water) or just absence) are chemicals. CHEBI covers sugars, amino acids, etc. It even has classes for "carbon sources" vs "nitrogen sources" in a chemical classification sense. We will use CHEBI IDs for things like L-arabinose (CHEBI:16716), succinic acid (CHEBI:15741), etc.

   - **ECO:** Biolog PM data has specific ECO terms that must be used:
     - ECO:0001091 (phenotype microarray evidence) - specifically for Biolog PM assays
     - ECO:0005024 (growth inhibition assay evidence) - for negative growth results
     - ECO:0000033 (author statement) - for documenting the categorical thresholds
     
     The three-tier classification (No Growth/Low Growth/Growth) requires ECO documentation of:
     - What OD or color change defines each category
     - Time point of measurement (typically 24-48 hours)
     - Comparison methodology to positive/negative controls
     - Instrument settings and data processing

   - **ENVO or OBI for media:** If available, an ENVO term like *"nutrient medium"* or *"minimal medium"* can be combined with CHEBI to define the environment. Alternatively, OBI might have terms for specific Biolog plates or media formulations. Since Biolog conditions are quite specific, this might be a case for MCO (we'll discuss that). Without MCO, we might represent the condition as a conjunction of "minimal medium" and "X present as carbon source" using ENVO + CHEBI. Or simpler, treat each condition as "[CHEBI compound] as carbon source" concept.

   - **NCBITaxon:** Tag the organism (MG1655 is taxon 511693 if we go strain level, but species is 562). Since this is a single strain, in the database we'd link the phenotypes to MG1655's identifier.

   - **PATO + UO for quantitative hints:** If we had actual values, we might use Unit Ontology (UO) for something like growth yield, but since it's qualitative, we may not need UO except to specify temperature (37 Â°C, UO:0000027) or pH if needed (the data doesn't explicitly list pH or time, probably standard).

   - **GO (to interpret results):** Not for annotation directly, but to link these phenotypes to metabolic processes. For example, MG1655's inability to grow on L-arabinose (if true) could be connected to GO:0019568 (arabinose catabolic process) -- perhaps something is off in the operon. Generally, GO would indicate that MG1655 has all the genes for these processes, so phenotypes should match the presence of GO functions. Any discrepancy (like arabinose) might flag regulatory quirks rather than gene absence.

   - **Annotations for "Low Growth":** We might need to define what threshold qualifies as "Low". In an ontology context, we could use PATO plus perhaps an ontology of measurement to say "optical density at 24h = X, which is lower than control". But given the user's interest, this might be too granular. Suffice to mark it as decreased growth qualitatively.

   - **Integration with others:** Many compounds here overlap with the previous dataset (ANL-SDL 48 isolates) and with RB-TnSeq conditions (e.g. glucose, fructose). We should ensure the same CHEBI IDs and condition descriptors are used across, to integrate properly. That's where consistent ontology usage (or introducing MCO/OMP across all) is key.

   - In summary, CHEBI and PATO are the core for describing each test result, but to package them into a meaningful statement, we either need a custom template or use MCO/OMP as a wrapper.

### Specialized Microbial Ontology Comparison

1. **OMP (Ontology of Microbial Phenotypes) Assessment:**

   - **Coverage:** OMP includes terms for utilization phenotypes and can accommodate the categories like "no growth", "low growth" on a given nutrient. For MG1655, since it's a single strain result, we'd annotate e.g. *"able to grow on X"* or *"unable to grow on X"*. OMP also has terms that correspond to the Biolog PM outcomes -- for instance, "growth delayed or reduced" could map to something like *"decreased growth rate on X"* in OMP hierarchy. The ontology will cover nearly all compounds as in the previous dataset case, and it has the flexibility to indicate degrees of growth.

   - **Advantages:** OMP would allow us to use consistent phenotype terms as we did for the 48 isolates. The difference here is we have an extra category (Low Growth). OMP can handle that by either a specific term or by combining a "decreased growth" term with the condition. OMP's structure might have a term for "partial utilization of carbon source" or simply we annotate as "growth present but reduced" -- the ontology has a way to capture that nuance. Also, OMP has the notion of wild-type phenotypes vs mutant phenotypes; in this case MG1655 is wild-type (not a mutant), but OMP can still be used to describe wild-type traits. It's designed for microbial phenotypes broadly, not just mutants. By using OMP, we ensure that the language of phenotypes for MG1655 is the same as for the other datasets, so one can compare a wild-type reference to mutant libraries.

   - **Example with OMP:**
     - L-Arabinose: if indeed MG1655 failed in this test, we'd give it an OMP term like "inability to utilize L-arabinose". If MG1655 is actually able, but just didn't in this experiment, that raises a question. But going by data, we'd annotate what we observed.
     - N-Acetylglucosamine: "Low Growth" -- OMP might call this "growth on N-acetylglucosamine decreased" or some term indicating slower growth. Possibly OMP would treat it as an abnormal phenotype since wild-type is expected to grow well on GlcNAc; or we just state it as is.
     - Succinate: "Growth" -- we might or might not annotate positive phenotypes. If we do, OMP term "able to utilize succinate" exists.
     - Generally, OMP's terms align with Biolog outcomes. In fact, OMP could have been populated using data like these historically, so we might find direct matches.

   - **Recommendation:** **Yes, employ OMP.** It will cover the nutrient utilization phenotypes comprehensively. Especially because MG1655's phenotype data serves as a reference, using OMP terms means we can later say "MG1655 has phenotype X, whereas mutant Y lost it" in a comparative way. *Confidence: 10/10* -- OMP will handle these phenotypes well and ensures consistency with the isolate dataset and any mutant datasets.

2. **MCO (Microbial Conditions Ontology) Assessment:**

   - **Coverage:** MCO can describe each test well's condition thoroughly. Many of these conditions might already be enumerated in MCO's knowledge base since they are standard Biolog tests. If not explicitly, we can create them. For example: *"Biolog PM1 A2: L-arabinose as sole carbon source (in IF-0 minimal base)"* -- MCO could have a term for that. MCO's approach of combining base medium + variable fits perfectly here because that's exactly how PM plates are structured.

   - **Advantages:** Using MCO for the conditions means we won't treat "L-arabinose carbon source" in this dataset differently from how we treat it in the 48 isolates dataset or RB-TnSeq dataset. It unifies the concept of "growth on L-arabinose" across all our data. Also, MCO might include synonyms or mappings to Biolog plate/well identifiers, which could be useful if we ever integrate with external databases that recognize Biolog tests. Another advantage is if MG1655's data is considered a gold standard, we can annotate the condition once in MCO and reuse it across. For instance, an MCO term for "medium with N-acetylglucosamine as carbon source" can be referenced in MG1655's phenotype and also in any other strain's phenotype for the same test. This avoids duplication and potential inconsistencies (like writing "N-Acetyl-D-glucosamine" in one place and "N-acetylglucosamine" in another -- they'd all point to the same MCO term).

   - **Example Conditions via MCO:**
     - Condition for well A3 (N-acetylglucosamine): MCO term that might be structured from CHEBI: combined with something indicating it's a carbon source. MCO's methodology likely has classes such as *"growth condition with carbon source X"*.
     - Condition for well in nitrogen plate, e.g. "L-Glutamine as nitrogen source (with some carbon in base)" -- MCO would handle that by having an attribute for nitrogen source.
     - Actually, MCO's initial focus was on gene expression conditions, but they included terms like medium components. They explicitly mention using MicrO for culture media in development. So if Biolog's base media are documented (IF-0a, etc.), those might be included as well.

   - **Recommendation:** **Yes, integrate MCO.** It adds a consistent layer for describing these varied nutrient conditions. MG1655's phenotype data is only truly useful in comparison -- either comparing to other strains or to mutants -- and having a common condition ontology is crucial for that. MCO will serve that role. *Confidence: 9/10* -- We're highly confident in the benefit. The only caution is we may need to define some terms corresponding to Biolog wells if not present, but that's a straightforward extension given MCO's design.

### Implementation Recommendations

- **Plan with OMP/MCO/ECO:** We will annotate each well's outcome as a phenotype of MG1655. The annotation triple (or set) will include: MG1655 (as the organism), the phenotype (OMP term), the condition (MCO term), and an evidence (ECO term referencing the PM assay). We should decide how to handle "Low Growth" -- likely map to an OMP term representing reduced growth. If OMP lacks a specific term for "growth significantly reduced but not absent", we can use a combination: possibly annotate both a "present" and an "abnormal" phenotype. Alternatively, treat "Low Growth" as *"decreased growth"* phenotype. OMP does have terms for different growth levels (e.g. *"growth rate decreased"*).

- **ECO for Categorical Data:** Each growth category must be linked to its criteria via ECO:
  ```
  Growth Status: "Low Growth"
  Evidence: ECO:0001091 (phenotype microarray evidence)
  Criteria: ECO:0000033 (author statement)
  Details: "OD590 between 0.1-0.3 relative to positive control at 48 hours"
  ```

- **Normalization of terms:** We must ensure consistent compound naming through CHEBI links. For instance, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine in one dataset might be written as N-acetylglucosamine in another -- by using CHEBI:506227 in both, we unify them. MCO will help since it probably uses CHEBI under the hood for specifying components.

- **Cross-check anomalies:** If any result contradicts known biology (like arabinose issue), we might check if MG1655 had a mutation (some MG1655 stocks have a loss-of-function in arabinose utilization by chance). Regardless, we'll annotate what the data says, perhaps with a note if needed.

- **Integration into database:** Once MG1655's phenotypes are in ontology form, we can compare it to the 48 isolates easily. For example, if MG1655 can use a substrate but a certain isolate cannot, a query on OMP terms will reveal that difference (MG1655 has "able to utilize X", isolate has "unable to utilize X"). This demonstrates the value of ontologies in making comparisons computationally trivial.

- **Maintaining categories:** For user-friendly outputs, we might maintain a mapping of OMP terms back to human-readable like "No Growth / Low Growth / Growth". OMP term names are usually understandable but sometimes generic. We may want to preserve the semi-quantitative nature by perhaps adding an annotation property for "qualifier: low/high". But since OMP can incorporate "decreased", we likely rely on that.

- **Conclusion for MG1655:** By adopting OMP/MCO/ECO for MG1655, we future-proof the annotation. Should we add more PM data (other strains, mutants, or conditions like pH, oxygen variation), we'll continue in the same framework. The cost is minimal -- OMP, MCO, and ECO integration done for other files covers this as well. Summarily, MG1655's phenotype profile becomes a rich, queryable resource in our integrated database.

## Cross-Dataset Synthesis

- **Overall Ontology Coverage (Current vs Specialized):** Using only the general ontologies (GO, PATO, ENVO, CHEBI, ECO, etc.), we find that a substantial portion of the data can be described, but in a piecemeal and often cumbersome way. Chemical names and basic conditions are well-covered by CHEBI and ENVO (we estimate ~90% of specific substances and media can be found there). Qualities like presence/absence of growth are covered by PATO (~100% of qualitative states). Evidence types are well-covered by ECO (~95% of experimental approaches). However, **complete phenotypic statements** (organism X has phenotype Y in condition Z with evidence E) are not directly represented as single classes in any current ontology we listed. We often need to assemble them from multiple pieces, which is error-prone. The coverage in terms of *ease of use and one-to-one mapping to data points* is low -- perhaps only ~30-40% of the phenotypes could be captured without creating new composite terms or extensions. In contrast, introducing OMP and MCO would raise the coverage to near-complete. OMP provides terms for virtually all phenotypic observations (with an ontology class or well-defined pattern for each). MCO covers the experimental condition space. With OMP/MCO/ECO, we expect >95% of our phenotype data points map to an existing ontology class or one that can be added following an established structure. The few gaps (if any) could be novel compounds or extremely specific conditions, which are straightforward to add.

- **Strengths of Current Approach:** The general ontologies we have are powerful for certain things -- CHEBI gives us standardized chemical identities, GO gives functional context, ENVO/OBI can describe environment and assays, ECO provides rigorous evidence tracking. They are also broad, meaning our work could interoperate with non-microbe data (should we ever compare to yeast or others, PATO, CHEBI, and ECO are universal). For integrating into larger frameworks (like if we wanted to feed data to a general phenotype aggregator), using basic ontologies might seem initially appealing. Also, we avoid dependency on niche ontologies by staying general.

- **Limitations and Integration Hurdles:** However, the limitations are stark: microbial phenotypes often require linking an organism, a condition, an outcome, and evidence. Without OMP/MCO, we must manually maintain those linkages. This not only increases the annotation workload, but also makes integration into a database inefficient. We'd likely have to run complex queries that join multiple ontology terms to retrieve something simple like "all salt-sensitive phenotypes". There's also a higher risk of inconsistencies; one curator might annotate "growth decreased in 5% NaCl" while another writes "osmotolerance reduced", and these would not be trivially recognized as the same without a shared ontology term. Without proper ECO integration, we lose the ability to filter by evidence quality or distinguish between experimental approaches. In summary, the current approach yields fragmented annotations that are harder to integrate across datasets.

- **Improvement with OMP/MCO/ECO:** By adopting OMP, MCO, and ECO across all datasets, we unify the representation of phenotypes, conditions, and evidence. A phenotype like *"unable to grow on galacturonate"* will be annotated the same way whether it comes from the BW25113 TnSeq data or the MG1655 PM data or the isolates. This allows direct comparison: We could ask, "How many genes, when knocked out, cause inability to grow on galacturonate (OMP term)?" and also "Which natural isolates have inability to grow on galacturonate (OMP term)?" -- and the query would use one term, pulling data from Nichols et al. and the 48 isolates seamlessly. MCO similarly standardizes conditions: "galacturonate as carbon source" in one dataset is the same condition class in another. ECO allows us to distinguish evidence quality: transposon data (ECO:0007032) might be weighted differently than binary growth assays (ECO:0001091). This ontology-driven uniformity is the key to **cross-dataset integration**. We will be able to merge these datasets logically, answering questions like:

  - Are there phenotypes in the RB-TnSeq gene dataset that correspond to traits varying in natural isolates? (e.g., A gene required for salicin utilization in the lab strain might coincide with some isolates being unable to use salicin. Ontologies let us connect the gene to the trait and the trait to the population.)
  - Does MG1655's phenotype profile align with the isolate profiles? (We can directly compare MG1655's OMP annotations to those 48 isolates since MG1655 is essentially one of the species entries -- if MG1655 wasn't in the isolate set, we can still conceptually treat it as such.)
  - Which ontological categories of phenotypes are covered by all datasets vs which are unique? (e.g., Antibiotic resistance phenotypes appear only in Nichols dataset; carbon source utilization appears in all; with OMP, these are high-level classes we can count and map.)
  - What is the evidence basis for conflicting phenotypes? (ECO codes reveal if differences arise from experimental methods rather than biology.)

- **Unified Annotation Strategy:** We propose a unified strategy where:

  - **OMP** is the central ontology for any *observable microbial phenotype*. All phenotype annotations, be it gene knockout effects or strain traits, will use OMP classes. This drastically simplifies querying: one ontology to search for phenotypes of interest.

  - **MCO** (with CHEBI and ENVO as needed) is used for describing *conditions and environmental contexts*. All specific media, substrate, stress, or perturbation is described via MCO (which itself uses CHEBI for chemicals and other OBO ontologies for physical conditions). This means each unique experimental condition across our datasets has a record in a controlled vocabulary. We can then relate phenotypes to conditions via standard relations (like has_condition or OMP's built-in annotation extensions).

  - **ECO** is mandatory for documenting *how phenotypes were determined*. Every phenotype annotation must include:
    - Primary evidence type (e.g., ECO:0007032 for transposon mutagenesis)
    - Quantitative details (fitness scores, p-values, colony sizes)
    - Experimental parameters (replicates, time points, thresholds)
    - Quality metrics (correlation scores, normalization methods)

  - **Additional linkages:** We still use NCBITaxon for organisms, and we link genes to NCBITaxon or to a strain entity so that queries can be organism-specific. 

  - **Quality Control:** This unified approach also helps in data quality checks -- if a phenotype in Nichols data is labeled with an OMP term and a similar phenotype in another dataset isn't, we can catch that discrepancy. ECO evidence codes help identify when apparent conflicts are due to different experimental approaches. It encourages consistency in how curators interpret results.

- **Cost-Benefit Analysis:**

  - *Costs of adding OMP/MCO/ECO:* There is an initial cost in training the team to use these ontologies and in mapping legacy data. We might need to invest time to convert existing annotations or dataset entries into OMP terms (writing scripts to match terms by names or definitions, and manually handling those that don't match). For ECO, we need to extract and structure evidence metadata from each dataset. Maintenance-wise, we will track updates to OMP/MCO/ECO and occasionally contribute requests for new terms. There's also a minor overhead in data storage (we store ontology IDs and manage ontology files in our system) but that's negligible.

  - *Benefits:* The benefits are significant. We gain **interoperability** -- our data speaks the same language as other microbial phenotype databases (e.g., if we publish our data, others using OMP can integrate it easily). **Query power** is greatly enhanced -- users can query by ontology classes (e.g. "show me all auxotrophy phenotypes in the database" and get results across strains and experiments). **Evidence-based filtering** -- users can filter for high-confidence results or specific experimental approaches. **Analytics:** We can perform higher-level analysis like clustering phenotypes by ontology category (maybe see that most isolate variability is in carbon utilization, whereas most gene knockouts affect stress response -- ontologies can group phenotypes by type to reveal such patterns).

  - *Risk mitigation:* By adopting community ontologies, we reduce the risk of our annotations becoming obsolete or incompatible. OMP and MCO are actively developed (OMP since ~2014, MCO since ~2019) and ECO is a mature OBO Foundry ontology, all backed by communities, meaning they will likely persist and improve. This external support is valuable -- we're not building our own ontology from scratch.

  - *Scalability:* As our database grows (more strains, conditions, genes), having OMP/MCO/ECO ensures scaling doesn't exponentially increase complexity. We'll already have templates for new entries (just plug into the ontology where it fits). Without them, each expansion would require thinking anew how to label and relate things.

- **Evidence Integration Benefits:** The proper use of ECO across all datasets provides unique advantages:
  - **Meta-analysis capability:** Can weight evidence differently based on experimental approach
  - **Reproducibility:** Complete documentation of how each phenotype was determined
  - **Conflict resolution:** When datasets disagree, ECO helps determine if it's biology or methodology
  - **Quality filtering:** Users can request only high-confidence annotations
  - **Provenance tracking:** Complete audit trail from raw data to phenotype call

- **Conclusion:** The specialized microbial ontologies (OMP, MCO) combined with rigorous evidence tracking (ECO) offer a clear path to harmonize these diverse datasets (gene fitness, mutant screens, isolate traits, and reference strain profiles) under a common framework. They drastically reduce annotation ambiguity, improve integration, and ensure scientific reproducibility, which aligns perfectly with the goal of ontology-based database integration. Given the analysis, **we strongly favor integrating OMP, MCO, and ECO into our curation workflow across all datasets (Confidence in recommendation: 10/10)**. The short-term effort is outweighed by the long-term gains in data usability, scientific rigor, and integrative biology insights we can extract from these rich phenotype datasets.# Ontology Analysis of Microbial Phenotype Datasets

## File: RBTnSeq-BW25113_sample.xlsx

### Data Structure Summary

- **Sheets & Purpose:** The workbook contains three sheets: **BW25113** (main data matrix), **exp-meta** (experiment metadata), and **Sheet3** (raw barcode data). The BW25113 sheet lists E. coli BW25113 genes (by locusId and gene name) with numeric phenotype values across many conditions. The exp-meta sheet provides descriptions for each experiment (condition name, media, etc.), and Sheet3 appears to contain raw transposon insertion counts per barcode.

- **Key Columns:** In the BW25113 sheet, each row is a gene (columns for locusId, sysName (gene symbol), and desc (gene description)). Subsequent columns represent different growth conditions or timepoints. Column headers are experiment identifiers (e.g. set1IT003) along with a short description like *"D-Glucose (C)"* or *"LB"*. These denote the specific substrates or media used (e.g. D-Glucose as Carbon source, LB medium).

- **Data Types & Patterns:** The phenotype values are numerical (likely fitness scores or log2 fold changes in mutant abundance). For example, negative values indicate a growth defect for that mutant in the given condition, whereas values near zero indicate neutral effect. The exp-meta sheet shows metadata per condition (e.g. each set1ITxxx entry has fields for mapped reads, correlation, etc.), confirming these are results of a high-throughput fitness assay (random barcoded transposon sequencing). Sheet3 is a detailed table of transposon barcodes mapped to loci, with read count metrics per condition, underpinning the summarized gene fitness in the main sheet.

### Microbial Data Analysis

- **Phenotypic Traits:** This dataset captures *gene knockout fitness phenotypes* across a variety of nutrient conditions. Essentially, it tells us which genes are important for growth under each condition. Many conditions are **carbon sources in minimal medium** (e.g. D-Glucose, D-Fructose, Sucrose, D-Galacturonic Acid in M9 minimal media), plus a rich medium (LB) and initial Time0 controls. The phenotypes are typically measured as *growth deficiencies*: a significantly negative value suggests the mutant is unable to grow well when that gene is disrupted, implying the gene is required for that condition.

- **Environmental Conditions & Substrates:** The conditions include different **carbon sources** (sugars and sugar acids) provided as the sole carbon source in minimal media, as well as a complete medium (LB). For example, "D-Galacturonic Acid (C) M9" indicates minimal M9 medium with D-galacturonate as the carbon source. Each such condition tests the bacterium's metabolic capability to utilize that substrate. Environmental factors are primarily nutritional here, though other stress conditions could be present if the full dataset were included (this sample focuses on carbon utilization).

- **Taxonomic/Strain Info:** All data are for *Escherichia coli* strain BW25113 (the Keio collection parent). The locus IDs and gene names correspond to E. coli K-12 genes. No other species are involved in this file.

- **Grouped Phenotypes:** Phenotypes can be grouped by metabolic function. For instance, mutants in genes of the **glycolysis pathway** show defects on glucose/fructose; mutants in **galacturonate metabolism genes** (e.g. *uxu* or *gar* genes) would specifically drop fitness in D-galacturonate condition. We see patterns like the *thr* operon genes have strong negative scores in minimal media (needed for amino acid biosynthesis), etc. Thus, the data ties each gene to functional phenotype categories: carbon catabolism, amino acid biosynthesis (essential in minimal media unless supplemented), central metabolism, etc. Overall data quality is high, with quantitative gradation of fitness effects, but interpretation often reduces to binary (phenotype present/absent) after significance testing.

### Current Ontology Assessment

1. **Best Available Ontology:** **PATO (Phenotypic Quality Ontology)** -- *Coverage:* ~50% of the needed concepts (rough estimate). PATO provides generic terms for qualities like "decreased growth rate" or "abolished growth" which can describe the observed phenotypes. *Strengths:* PATO can represent the **magnitude and direction of fitness effects** (e.g. increased or decreased growth) in a formal way. It's organism-agnostic and built to pair with specific entity terms. Using PATO, one could say a mutant has "decreased growth rate" (a quality) in a given condition. *Limitations:* PATO alone doesn't specify the **context or target** of the phenotype -- it lacks terms for specific substrates or processes. We would have to combine it with other ontologies to indicate "in presence of D-fructose" or "growth of E. coli population". It also doesn't have pre-composed terms for complex microbial phenotypes, so each annotation becomes a conjunction of terms (growth process + quality + condition). *Example Mappings:*

   - A gene with a large negative value on sucrose might be annotated as having "abolished growth" (PATO:0002053) under sucrose condition.
   - A smaller fitness defect on glucose could map to "decreased growth rate" (PATO:0002303) in glucose.
   - Neutral effects would correspond to "normal growth" quality.

   These PATO terms describe the phenotype magnitude, but we'd still need to reference **glucose (CHEBI:17234)** or the condition "minimal medium with glucose" via another ontology.

2. **Complementary Ontologies Needed:** To fully cover the data, multiple ontologies must work together:

   - **CHEBI (Chemical Entities of Biological Interest):** Provides IDs for each substrate/compound (glucose, fructose, galacturonate, etc.). Nearly all carbon sources here are chemical compounds well-defined in CHEBI. Using CHEBI, we can unambiguously annotate the compounds tested (e.g. CHEBI:15903 for D-fructose).

   - **ENVO (Environmental Ontology):** Can describe complex media or environment settings. For example, an *"M9 minimal medium"* or *"LB broth"* could be referenced by ENVO terms if available. ENVO also has terms for environmental contexts like aerobic conditions, temperature, etc., which could be relevant if those vary (not heavily in this dataset, but generally useful).

   - **OBI (Ontology for Biomedical Investigations):** Could be used to represent the experimental assay (e.g. "transposon sequencing assay") or data generation method. It ensures the **metadata** (like Time0 vs selection) is formally captured. OBI might also have terms for *"growth curve measurement"* or *"fitness score"* which are relevant to how the phenotype is measured.

   - **ECO (Evidence and Conclusion Ontology):** **Critical for capturing how phenotypes were determined.** For RBTnSeq data, relevant ECO terms include:
     - ECO:0007032 (transposon mutagenesis evidence) - captures the methodology
     - ECO:0007631 (high throughput mutant phenotypic evidence) - for the screening approach
     - ECO:0000362 (computational inference from multiple sources) - for fitness score calculations
     - ECO:0000053 (computational combinatorial evidence) - for integrating barcode counts
     
     ECO allows us to capture experimental parameters like statistical thresholds (e.g., |fitness| > 2 for significance), number of replicates (from exp-meta), quality metrics (correlation values, MAD scores), and time points (T0 vs selection). This is essential for data reproducibility and quality assessment.

   - **NCBITaxon:** To link the strain and any genetic identifiers to the species *E. coli* (NCBITaxon:562). This is important for database integration, so it's clear these phenotypes pertain to E. coli and not another organism.

   - **GO (Gene Ontology):** (secondary use) While GO is not meant for phenotypes, it can provide insight into the **biological processes** each gene is involved in. For integration, one might map a phenotype to a GO term representing the lost function (e.g. inability to grow on galacturonate corresponds to GO:0046396 "galacturonate catabolic process"). GO terms won't directly describe the phenotype, but they strengthen database integration by linking gene function to the observed phenotype.

   - **RO (Relation Ontology):** Needed for linking these ontologies together (e.g. an annotation might use relations like "has_participant" or "occurs in presence of" to connect a growth phenotype with a chemical or condition).

   - Using these in combination, we could describe a single data point (e.g. "ÎgeneX has decreased growth rate in medium with fructose at 37Â°C"). However, the assembly is complex and still missing the convenience of a dedicated microbial phenotype vocabulary. Many phenotype concepts (like *"conditionally essential gene"*) would have to be constructed from scratch using general ontologies.

### Specialized Microbial Ontology Comparison

1. **OMP (Ontology of Microbial Phenotypes) Assessment:**

   - **Improved Coverage:** OMP is specifically designed to capture microbial phenotypic traits. It would likely cover this dataset almost entirely. For example, OMP has pre-coordinated terms for phenotypes like *"auxotrophy"*, *"sensitivity to chemical"*, or *"growth absent on carbon source"*. These align closely with the knockout fitness phenotypes here. OMP can represent that a mutant **cannot grow on a given substrate** or has **altered growth in a condition** with single terms, rather than having to piece together multiple ontologies. This leads to a much higher coverage (estimated >90%) of the phenotypes in this file.

   - **Advantages over Current Approach:** OMP provides microbial context and granularity that PATO/GO alone do not. It includes terms that inherently combine the quality and the context (e.g. "abolished growth on carbon source X" as a single class). This means less custom assembly for each phenotype and more consistency. It's built on BFO/PATO foundations, ensuring logical structure, but extends with microbe-specific needs. In practice, using OMP would standardize how we describe "gene required for growth on fructose" with a controlled term instead of a free-text or ad hoc combination.

   - **Example Phenotypes Better Captured:** For instance, if **gene galK** shows a fitness defect on galactose, OMP might have a term like "inability to utilize galactose" (or a parent term "growth defect on galactose carbon source"). Similarly, a mutant that only grows in rich medium (but not minimal) could be annotated as "auxotrophic phenotype" via OMP. These nuanced microbial phenotypes are explicitly enumerated in OMP's hierarchy.

   - **Recommendation:** **Yes, add OMP.** This dataset would greatly benefit from OMP. It would simplify ontology annotation (one term can capture what previously required linking 2-3 ontologies) and ensure the phenotypes are described in the same language as other microbial databases. *Confidence: 10/10* -- OMP was developed for exactly these scenarios of high-throughput microbial phenotype data, so it will integrate smoothly.

2. **MCO (Microbial Conditions Ontology) Assessment:**

   - **Improved Coverage:** MCO focuses on describing growth **conditions** in microbiology. Many condition details in this dataset (specific media recipes, nutrient sources, growth parameters) could be covered by MCO's controlled vocabulary. For example, MCO includes terms for various media components and environmental factors, which would map well to things like *"M9 minimal medium with 0.2% glucose"*, *"LB broth"*, or *"minimal medium lacking amino acid X"*. Using MCO, we can precisely identify each experimental condition with a term or a combination of terms drawn from a standardized set. This is better than relying on free-text or generic ENVO classes that might not exist for lab media.

   - **Advantages over Current Approach:** The current approach would use CHEBI for chemicals and perhaps ENVO for environment, but ENVO may not have granular terms for laboratory media formulations or specific culture conditions. MCO was explicitly created to unify the vocabulary of microbial growth conditions. It provides a structured way to encode temperature, medium, supplements, aeration, etc., in one framework. For example, instead of loosely saying "glucose minimal medium (C source)", we could use an MCO class that formally defines that condition. This increases interoperability -- e.g. one lab's "LB" is the same as another lab's "LB" by reference to the same MCO term, avoiding naming ambiguities. As a relatively new ontology, it sets a consistent standard for condition annotation.

   - **Example Conditions Better Captured by MCO:** A condition like *"M9 + D-fructose (carbon source) without amino acid supplements"* can be represented in MCO by combining terms for base medium, carbon source, and any omissions. If a condition was *"LB pH 5 + 1 mM H2O2" (oxidative stress in acidic rich medium)*, MCO would allow encoding each aspect (medium type, pH, additive) in a machine-readable way. In our dataset, conditions such as "D-Galacturonic Acid (C) M9" would be mapped to an MCO term for M9 minimal media plus galacturonate. **LB** (Lysogeny Broth) is a common media that general ontologies might lack; MCO either includes it or would integrate a term from OBI/MicrO for LB -- either way it formalizes it.

   - **Recommendation:** **Yes, add MCO.** MCO would significantly enhance the description of experimental contexts for each phenotype. It ensures that all these carbon source tests and media types are referenced to a consistent ontology, which is crucial for database integration of phenotype data. *Confidence: 9/10* -- MCO is highly applicable; the only minor caveat is that it's a newer ontology, so a few very specific conditions might need to be added. But its design (drawing on existing ontology components and being extendable) makes it a robust choice for our needs.

### Implementation Recommendations

- **Using Current Ontologies (if OMP/MCO not added):** We would need to implement a multi-ontology annotation schema. This means for each phenotype data point we create a composite annotation. For example: *Entity:* "growth of E. coli BW25113 in M9+glucose" -- which itself might be modeled using ENVO/CHEBI for the environment and NCBITaxon for the organism, *Quality:* "decreased rate" (PATO), and possibly a relation like "has condition" linking to the chemical. Critically, we must also capture *Evidence:* using ECO terms like ECO:0007032 (transposon mutagenesis) along with quantitative values (fitness score, p-value, barcode counts). To do this efficiently, we should establish standard templates (ontology design patterns) for common cases (e.g. *Growth/no growth in X*). We should also map each experimental condition in exp-meta to a combination of CHEBI (for the carbon source) and a base medium term. Perhaps creating an internal library of terms like "growth in glucose (phenotype)" to reuse. This approach is labor-intensive and prone to inconsistencies unless carefully governed. For database integration, we'd need to ensure each composite annotation is stored in a consistent way (perhaps as OWL expressions or as multiple triple statements). It's doable, but the complexity is high. **Optimization:** focus on the most significant phenotypes -- we could limit to documenting "no growth" vs "growth" qualitatively per gene-condition, rather than raw numeric values, to make annotation tractable. Additionally, integrating GO terms for gene function could help infer phenotypes, but that would be supplementary.

- **Integrating OMP/MCO (recommended):** We would import OMP and MCO into our ontology ecosystem. The phenotypic annotations would then be done largely with single classes from OMP for the phenotype and classes from MCO for the condition, linked by standard relations. For instance, we could annotate: *Gene X -- "OMP:0007234 (unable to grow on galacturonate)" -- evidence ECO:0007032 -- strain BW25113*. That single OMP term would implicitly refer to the condition of galacturonate as carbon source. If needed, we can use MCO to define the condition more explicitly in the background (e.g. an OMP term might have a logical definition tying it to an MCO term for the presence of galacturonate). **Integration Approach:** We'd treat OMP and MCO as part of our annotation pipeline: curators or algorithms would lookup appropriate OMP terms for each phenotype. Where an exact term is missing, OMP is designed to be extendable -- we could request new terms (the OMP developers actively add terms as new phenotypes arise). MCO integration would involve mapping our experiment metadata (e.g. exp-meta descriptions "D-Glucose (C)") to MCO classes. We may need to create a few custom IDs if our media formulations are unique, but given MCO's emphasis on E. coli conditions, many common ones are likely present.

- **Data Transformation with ECO:** With OMP/MCO, our raw data (fitness scores) would be transformed into qualitative phenotype calls. This means setting criteria (e.g. fitness < -4 = "no growth phenotype"). We'd generate a list of gene-condition pairs that meet phenotype significance, then assign OMP terms accordingly. This binarization/generalization loses some numeric detail, but it's necessary for ontology-based annotation. Those threshold decisions must be documented using ECO. For example:
  - ECO:0007032 (transposon mutagenesis evidence) with annotation properties for:
    - Threshold criteria: "fitness < -2 indicates growth defect"
    - Statistical confidence: p-value < 0.01
    - Technical details: number of barcodes, read counts from exp-meta
    - Quality metrics: correlation values (cor12), MAD scores (mad12c)
  
  A complete annotation would be: *Gene galK* has phenotype *OMP:0007234 (unable to grow on galacturonate)* with evidence *ECO:0007032* where fitness_score = -4.5, p-value < 0.001, based on 15,234 barcode reads across 2 replicates.

- Overall, adopting OMP, MCO, and properly utilizing ECO would front-load some work (setting up mappings, learning the ontologies), but it simplifies long-term maintenance. The ontologies are maintained by external communities, so updates (new terms, fixes) would benefit our system continuously. Given the goal of ontology annotation and database integration, the specialized ontologies combined with rigorous evidence tracking are aligned with best practices and will make our annotations more interoperable with resources like OMPwiki and RegulonDB.

### Data Structure Summary

- **Sheets & Purpose:** This file is a sample from the study *"Phenotypic Landscape of a Bacterial Cell" (Nichols et al. 2011)*, a large-scale E. coli mutant phenotype screen. It likely contains multiple sheets: one with **phenotype data** (mutant vs conditions matrix or list of phenotypes) and one or more with **condition metadata**. From the content glimpses, we see a "Condition" sheet that lists each tested condition along with details like supplier, item number, and target category (e.g. antibiotic target pathway). This suggests the dataset is organized with a clear separation of *conditions (independent variables)* and *mutant phenotypes (dependent variables)*.

- **Key Columns:** In the condition metadata sheet, expected columns are *Condition Name*, *Supplier/ID*, *Target or Stress Type*, and possibly *Concentration*. For example, conditions include chemical stresses like **Mecillinam** (an antibiotic targeting cell wall), **Hydrogen peroxide** (oxidative stress), **Sulfamonomethoxine** (an antimicrobial targeting folate synthesis). Each condition likely has a category (antibiotic, oxidative stress, nutrient limitation, etc.). In the phenotype data sheet, rows would correspond to gene knockouts (probably the Keio collection mutants for ~3,979 genes) and columns to conditions (324 conditions in the full dataset). Cells might be binary or numeric indicators of a significant growth defect. The study reported over 10,000 significant phenotypes, so the data might be encoded as a score or p-value per gene-condition, or a binary call if a phenotype was detected at a given false discovery rate.

- **Data Types & Patterns:** The phenotype data likely uses a numeric *fitness score* or *Z-score* per mutant per condition (similar to colony size ratios). Nichols et al. used normalized colony sizes; significant phenotypes were those where the mutant's colony size deviated under the condition. So we expect many zeros or blanks for "no phenotype" and some values or markers for "yes, phenotype". Possibly the sample is trimmed; it might list only a subset of conditions or mutants rather than the full matrix. The condition sheet is textual but structured (each condition in one row, with consistent columns for metadata). We saw evidence of comma-separated values like "16,18,20 Â°C" -- this hints some conditions involved temperatures (16, 18, 20Â°C are likely stresses) or possibly a range. So the data encompasses various **environmental stresses** (temperature, pH) in addition to chemicals. Overall, the dataset is structured for relational querying: one table of mutants vs conditions outcomes, one table describing conditions.

### Microbial Data Analysis

- **Types of Phenotypes:** This dataset covers a **broad spectrum of microbial phenotypes**, specifically the conditional essentiality or sensitivity of *E. coli* genes. Key phenotype types include:

  - **Antibiotic sensitivity/resistance:** e.g. mutants that cannot grow when a certain antibiotic is present (indicating the gene is needed to withstand or bypass the antibiotic's effect). For instance, a mutant hyper-sensitive to *Mecillinam* suggests that gene is involved in cell envelope integrity.

  - **Stress tolerance:** e.g. genes required for survival at high temperature, osmotic stress (e.g. high salt), oxidative stress (H2O2), acid stress (low pH), etc. These appear as phenotypes like "Îgene fails to grow at 42Â°C" or "Îgene has growth defect with 5 mM H2O2".

  - **Nutrient utilization or auxotrophy:** Some conditions could be nutrient limitations, e.g. minimal media lacking a specific amino acid or vitamin, or alternate carbon sources. A mutant that cannot grow without a supplement indicates auxotrophy (e.g. a biosynthetic gene knockout requiring the missing nutrient).

  - **Metabolic byproduct sensitivity:** Possibly tests like toxic metabolites or dyes that indicate metabolic state (e.g. a dye that certain mutants can't reduce).

  - **Multi-stress phenotypes:** Some genes (as noted in the study) affect growth in many conditions (called Multi-Stress Resistance genes). Those would show phenotypes across diverse categories (e.g. a chaperone gene mutant is sick under heat, oxidative, and antibiotic stresses collectively).

- **Example Data:** For antibiotics: the dataset includes conditions like *"Ampicillin -- 10 Î¼g/mL"* or *"Norfloxacin -- 5 Î¼M"*; a mutant in a DNA repair gene might show a phenotype under Norfloxacin (a DNA gyrase inhibitor), indicating increased sensitivity. For environmental stresses: *"Hydrogen peroxide (0.5 mM)"* would cause growth inhibition in peroxide-defense mutants (e.g. ÎoxyR). Nutrient example: *"No leucine"* medium would cause ÎleuB (leucine biosynthesis mutant) to not grow, flagging it as leucine auxotroph. The data likely encodes these as significant growth reduction (perhaps a score or a boolean). Quality-wise, given the scale, there may be some false positives/negatives near the significance threshold, but broadly it's a rich high-quality set of phenotypic linkages.

- **Environmental Conditions & Compounds:** The conditions cover a wide range of **chemical compounds** (antibiotics, antimicrobial chemicals, metabolites) and **physical conditions** (temperature, pH, osmolarity). Many chemicals are present at sublethal concentrations to probe sensitivities. Each condition typically has a known mode of action or category: e.g. *"Hydroxyurea"* (DNA synthesis inhibitor), *"Paraquat"* (superoxide generator), *"High NaCl 0.3M"* (osmotic stress). This dataset essentially maps out how each gene's disruption affects the ability to handle those specific conditions.

- **Taxonomic Info:** All data pertains to *E. coli* K-12 (strain MG1655 derivative, the "Keio+" collection). Mutants are isogenic aside from single-gene knockouts. There's no cross-species data here, but the conditions sometimes involve compounds derived from other organisms (e.g. antibiotics originally from microbes, but that's not taxonomy, just chemical origin).

- **Grouped Phenotypes by Function:** One can group phenotypes by the cellular process or pathway: e.g. **Cell envelope biosynthesis genes** -- many show up in antibiotics targeting the cell wall (Î²-lactams, detergents like SDS). **DNA/RNA replication genes** -- phenotypes with DNA damaging agents and replication inhibitors. **Chaperones and proteases** -- phenotypes at high temperature and oxidative stress. **Metabolic enzymes** -- phenotypes on specific nutrient omission. The dataset, as discussed in Nichols et al., revealed functional groupings where related genes cluster by shared phenotype profiles. This cross-condition correlation was a key analysis in the study: e.g. the *nuo* operon (NADH dehydrogenase) mutants all had similar patterns, and conditions clustered by targeting similar pathways. From a data perspective, it means many phenotypes are not random but logically connected sets, which an ontology could leverage (by linking to pathway or process terms).

### Current Ontology Assessment

1. **Best Available Ontology:** **PATO (Phenotypic Quality Ontology)** -- *Coverage:* ~40-50%. As with the previous dataset, PATO can supply general terms for the types of changes observed (e.g. "increased sensitivity", "decreased growth", "no growth"). Many of the phenotypes here are essentially "growth inhibited under X condition" which PATO would express as a quality of growth (present/absent/reduced). *Strengths:* PATO provides a uniform way to denote **abnormal vs normal phenotype**. For example, a mutant's phenotype of being sensitive to a compound can be described as "decreased viability in presence of compound" using a combination of PATO qualities (decreased viability) and an appropriate relation. PATO is also good for describing gradations (some mutants might have *mild* vs *severe* growth defects, which could be encoded as "moderately decreased growth" if such terms exist or via relational comparison). *Limitations:* PATO alone doesn't indicate *what* the organism is sensitive to or *which process* is affected. In this dataset, the identity of the condition (chemical or stress) is crucial -- PATO would treat "growth decreased" the same for heat or for ampicillin, so it must be paired with a term for the stress. Furthermore, certain phenotype concepts like "antibiotic sensitivity" or "auxotrophy" are composite ideas not pre-defined in PATO. We would need to create complex expressions every time. PATO doesn't have a notion of "resistance" vs "sensitivity" beyond saying increased or decreased growth; the **microbial context** (that it's due to an antibiotic) is external. *Example Mappings:*

   - "Mutant is sensitive to hydrogen peroxide" could be represented as *growth rate decreased (PATO:0002303)* **and** tie it to *hydrogen peroxide (CHEBI:16240)* via a relation like "in presence of".
   - "Mutant fails to grow at 42Â°C" might be *abolished growth (PATO:0002053)* with a condition "42 degree Celsius" (which might come from an ontology of units or a temperature quality). We'd need to borrow terms (e.g. UO:0000027 for Â°C and some way to say high temperature condition).
   - "Leucine auxotrophy" would be tricky: one could say *growth absent without leucine* by combining *absent growth* (PATO) + *leucine (CHEBI)* + some condition relation, but no single PATO term captures "auxotrophic for leucine".

   In summary, basic qualities are covered, but the specificity and ease of use are lacking with just PATO.

2. **Complementary Ontologies Needed:** To adequately describe this dataset, a suite of ontologies must be combined:

   - **CHEBI:** Vital for the chemical compounds (antibiotics, metabolites). All the drug names and chemicals (e.g. *mecillinam, sulfamonomethoxine, paraquat, sucrose*) can be mapped to CHEBI identifiers. CHEBI's coverage of these small molecules and antibiotics is very high (virtually 100% for known drugs and metabolites in the dataset). This ensures we unambiguously refer to "hydrogen peroxide" or "ampicillin" by their CHEBI IDs rather than free text.

   - **ECO:** This dataset particularly benefits from ECO as it involves complex chemical genomics screening. Relevant ECO terms include:
     - ECO:0001563 (colony size measurement evidence) - the primary assay type used by Nichols et al.
     - ECO:0007634 (chemical genetic interaction evidence) - for drug-gene interactions
     - ECO:0005516 (growth curve analysis evidence) - if growth kinetics were measured
     - ECO:0000180 (phenotypic similarity evidence) - for clustering related phenotypes
     - ECO:0000033 (author statement) - for categorical assignments of significance
     
     The Nichols et al. study used specific statistical methods (S-scores, p-values, false discovery rates) that ECO helps capture. We must document the normalization procedures, plate effects, and corrections applied. This ensures reproducibility and allows users to filter based on evidence quality.

   - **ENVO / OBI:** For physical and environmental conditions, we can leverage ENVO for things like *"high temperature environment"* or *"acidic pH condition"* if such terms exist. OBI might offer terms for specific assays (e.g. *"disk diffusion assay"* if relevant, or *"phenotype microarray"* if some conditions were tested that way). In Nichols et al.'s case, they used a plate-based growth assay, which could be captured as an OBI term for the procedure. ENVO could help with terms like *"anaerobic condition"* (if any anaerobic tests were done) or *"osmotic stress environment"*. However, ENVO might not have fine-grained lab conditions, which is where MCO (later) fills the gap.

   - **GO (Gene Ontology):** While GO doesn't describe phenotypes, linking each condition to the biological process it affects or each gene to its GO function can be informative. For example, if a phenotype is "sensitive to a DNA gyrase inhibitor", GO can supply *DNA topology/DNA replication* process terms to contextualize the gene's role. GO also has terms like "response to oxidative stress", but those refer to normal cellular processes, not the phenotype of a mutant. So GO would be used indirectly: for integration, one might annotate that *geneX has phenotype Y; geneX is involved in GO:0006979 (response to oxidative stress)* to connect phenotype to function.

   - **PCO (Population and Community Ontology):** This could be relevant to describe that the observation is about a *population of bacterial cells* (e.g. colony size is a population-level phenotype). PCO has terms for microbial populations, which might be useful if distinguishing single-cell vs population phenotypes. Nichols' assay deals with colony growth (population of clones of the mutant), so one could say *"population growth phenotype"* using PCO classes to be precise.

   - **In-house Ontologies (MetaCyc/KEGG/SEED):** These could help identify pathways for nutrient utilization or drug mechanisms. For example, MetaCyc/KEGG have pathways for leucine biosynthesis, which we could link to the leucine auxotrophy phenotypes. SEED or ModelSEED might classify the substrates (like grouping all carbon sources vs all sulfur sources), which could be used to find patterns (e.g. all compounds a mutant can't use share a pathway). These aren't phenotype ontologies, but they provide a layer of functional classification that can complement ontology annotation by linking gene -> pathway -> phenotype. For integration, one might want to tag a phenotype with the pathway it implicates (though that's more of an inference than an annotation).

   - **Relations (RO):** We will definitely need relations like has_participant or in_presence_of to link the phenotype quality to the specific condition from CHEBI/ENVO. E.g., an annotation pattern could be: *"ÎrecA exhibits PATO:0002303 (decreased growth)* ***in presence of*** *CHEBI:33841 (mitomycin C)"*. RO provides the formal "in presence of (RO:0002233)" or similar relations to structure this.

   - **Coverage & Integration:** Using all these ontologies, we could cover nearly all aspects of the data, but it's cumbersome. Each phenotype annotation becomes a complex assertion. There is also a risk of inconsistency: two curators might choose slightly different ways to compose the same phenotype (one might use *"decreased cell population growth"*, another *"reduced colony size"*). Without a unifying phenotype ontology, we rely on convention. The need for multiple ontologies indicates that no single available ontology fully covers "mutant microbial phenotypes in various conditions" -- reinforcing why OMP was developed.

### Specialized Microbial Ontology Comparison

1. **OMP (Ontology of Microbial Phenotypes) Assessment:**

   - **Better Coverage for Specific Phenotypes:** OMP would dramatically improve annotation of this dataset. It was in fact motivated by the lack of standardization in exactly these kinds of data. OMP contains terms that encapsulate common microbial phenotypes, meaning we wouldn't have to manually compose each one. For example, OMP has terms like *"antibiotic sensitivity phenotype"*, *"temperature sensitive growth"*, *"osmotic stress sensitive"*, *"auxotrophic phenotype"*, etc., often further specified by the agent or condition via ontology relations or extensions. Many of the 324 conditions in this study have corresponding OMP terms or can be linked to a parent term in OMP. Coverage would be high -- we expect OMP to directly cover the *majority of phenotype types* observed (likely >85% out-of-the-box, and the remainder could be added readily as new terms).

   - **Advantages over Current Approach:** Using OMP means we have *pre-defined classes for phenotypes* that inherently refer to the microbial context. We no longer have to separately state the quality and the condition each time; instead, a single term can capture both. For example, an OMP term like "sensitive to oxidative stress" could be specialized with the specific agent if needed. OMP also ensures consistency: every curator uses the same term for the same phenotype, rather than inventing their own phrasing. Moreover, OMP is designed to be **compatible with genotype annotations**, meaning it can link a phenotype to the specific allele or strain, and it integrates with evidence ontology for referencing experiments. This aligns perfectly with our database integration goal -- OMP terms can be used as common identifiers for querying across datasets.

   - **Example Phenotypes and OMP:** Consider the condition *"Mecillinam (cell wall antibiotic)"*. Instead of annotating *"growth decreased with mecillinam"* via generic ontologies, we could use an OMP term like **OMP:0006098 (increased cell wall antibiotic susceptibility)** or a similar term, then indicate the specific antibiotic as a context. OMP likely has a branch for antibiotic susceptibility, subdivided by target class if needed. Another example: for *42Â°C growth*, OMP might have **OMP:0005007 (temperature sensitive growth phenotype)**. For *"no growth without leucine"*, OMP provides terms for auxotrophy such as **OMP:0006139 (leucine auxotrophy)** or a general auxotrophy term that can be paired with the specific nutrient. Each of these terms encapsulates what would otherwise be a long description in plain language.

   - **Recommendation:** **Strongly recommend adding OMP.** OMP will handle virtually all phenotypes in this dataset with high fidelity to their biological meaning. It was created precisely to enable cross-experiment comparison of microbial phenotypes, which is our integration goal. By adopting OMP, we join a community standard, making our data comparable to other E. coli phenotype data (including this Nichols et al. dataset, which has been used to develop OMP terms). *Confidence: 10/10* -- OMP is a near-perfect fit for this dataset and will substantially reduce annotation ambiguity.

2. **MCO (Microbial Conditions Ontology) Assessment:**

   - **Better Coverage for Conditions:** The Nichols dataset involves a rich array of experimental conditions, which MCO is ideally suited to describe. MCO's goal is to standardize how we refer to growth conditions and media, which directly applies here. Many conditions involve combinations (e.g. a certain medium + a stressor at X concentration). MCO provides a structured way to encode these. For instance, an MCO term (or combination) could represent *"LB broth + 1.5 M NaCl"* (to indicate osmotic stress in rich medium) or *"M9 minimal medium lacking leucine"*. It includes terms for media recipes, environmental parameters (temperature, pH), and supplements, drawn from its curated library of E. coli experimental conditions.

   - **Advantages over Current Approach:** Without MCO, we would rely on CHEBI for chemicals and ad-hoc terms for other conditions. MCO is advantageous because it incorporates existing ontologies in a coherent way: it reuses CHEBI for chemicals, but also MicrO (an ontology of microbial media) for culture media names, and standard vocabularies for temperature, etc., assembling them into condition descriptors. As a result, using MCO means when we say *"37Â°C aerobic LB"*, it's unambiguous and identical across annotations. Another advantage is that MCO is built to handle the *multi-dimensional nature* of conditions (media, temperature, pH, oxygen, phase, etc.) by creating composite terms only when needed, keeping the ontology maintainable. For our dataset, this means the 324 conditions can be documented systematically. Also, if new conditions appear in future experiments, we simply extend MCO or find existing terms, rather than coming up with new descriptors.

   - **Example Conditions and MCO:** Let's illustrate a few:
     - *"42Â°C heat stress on minimal medium"* -- MCO would combine a term for the temperature (42Â°C, possibly via a quality or a preset term for high-temperature) with a term for the medium (e.g. M9 minimal medium).
     - *"Acidic pH 5 in LB"* -- MCO can represent pH as an attribute of the medium. We might have an MCO term for "pH 5 culture condition" that can link to LB medium term.
     - *"Paraquat 0.3 mM in minimal medium"* -- Paraquat (CHEBI term) could be included as an additive in an MCO term that defines a supplemented minimal medium condition. In fact, MCO's methodology includes combining simple ontology terms at annotation time rather than pre-coordinating everything. We could either create a class for "minimal medium with paraquat 0.3 mM" or annotate it as such via multiple annotations linked by an experiment ID.
     - Many of these conditions (especially chemical stresses) might already exist in MCO's seed set because they curated terms from RegulonDB and literature focusing on E. coli gene expression experiments. For example, RegulonDB contains many similar conditions for expression data; MCO was seeded from that, so terms like "paraquat stress" or "UV exposure" could be present or at least easily added.

   - **Recommendation:** **Yes, incorporate MCO.** MCO will allow us to precisely and uniformly describe all the conditions in this dataset, which is crucial for integrating the data into a database and comparing across studies. It prevents the scenario of having one condition called "high salt" in one place and "osmotic stress (NaCl)" in another -- both would use the same MCO descriptor. This dramatically improves data harmonization and queryability. *Confidence: 9/10* -- We are very confident MCO will add value. The slight deduction is only because implementing MCO requires some initial setup (ensuring all needed terms are present and possibly adding a few missing ones), but the ontology's structure is well-suited for expansion and the long-term payoff in consistency is worth it.

### Implementation Recommendations

- **Current Ontologies vs. OMP/MCO:** Given that our goal is comprehensive ontology-based annotation and integration, relying solely on general ontologies (PATO, CHEBI, etc.) for this complex dataset would be suboptimal. We can manage basic annotations (like "decreased growth in X") with general ontologies, but we lose specificity and ease of use. If we proceeded without OMP/MCO, we'd need to define templates for each category of phenotype (antibiotic sensitivity, thermosensitivity, auxotrophy, etc.) using combinations of terms. This would involve significant manual curation and a high chance of inconsistent representations. There's also a risk in integration: queries like "find all antibiotic-sensitive mutants" would be hard without a single ontology term tying them together (we'd have to query a pattern of CHEBI + PATO combinations). Critically, without proper ECO integration, we lose the ability to filter by evidence quality or experimental approach.

- **Adopting OMP/MCO with ECO (preferred):** Incorporating OMP and MCO into our annotation workflow is strongly recommended. Concretely, for each phenotype record, we would assign an OMP class as the primary phenotype descriptor, and use MCO (or linked CHEBI/ENVO terms) to specify the exact condition if not already inherent in the OMP term. We should map each condition in the Nichols condition list to an MCO term or a combination thereof. For conditions that have a one-to-one corresponding OMP term (like "streptomycin sensitivity"), we can use just the OMP term. For conditions that are unique (say a less common chemical), we use an appropriate parent OMP term plus mention the chemical via an extension.

- **Infrastructure with ECO:** We will integrate OMP and MCO ontologies into our database schema so that their classes are available as pick-lists for annotators or as references in data import scripts. Critically, we must also store the evidence using ECO. For Nichols data, we would use:
  - Primary evidence: ECO:0001563 (colony size measurement evidence)
  - Statistical details: S-scores, p-values, FDR thresholds as annotation properties
  - Experimental details: plate normalization, number of replicates
  
  Example complete annotation:
  ```
  Mutant: ÎrecA
  Phenotype: OMP:0006098 (increased antibiotic susceptibility)
  Condition: MCO:[mecillinam condition]
  Evidence: ECO:0001563 (colony size measurement)
  Evidence_details: S-score = -3.2, p-value = 0.001, FDR < 0.05, plate_normalized = true
  ```

- **Harmonization:** By using OMP for the Carol Gross/Nichols dataset and also for the RB-TnSeq dataset (previous file), we create a unified language. This is powerful: for example, OMP has a high-level term "condition-dependent phenotype" and sub-terms for specific conditions -- we could compare across datasets if a gene had a phenotype in both the chemical screen and the RB-TnSeq nutrient screen (the terms would share structure in OMP). ECO terms allow us to distinguish between different experimental approaches while maintaining comparability.

- **Data transformation needs:** Similar to RB-TnSeq, we need to convert raw numeric results into qualitative phenotypes. Nichols et al. already did significance analysis; presumably the dataset flags which gene-condition pairs are phenotypes at 5% FDR. We will use those as our criteria: e.g. any gene-condition with significant growth defect gets an OMP annotation. The magnitude (strong or weak) could be captured by OMP modifiers (some ontologies use "high magnitude" vs "low magnitude" phenotypes) or captured in a separate field if needed. All transformation criteria must be documented with ECO:0000033 (author statement) linking to the specific thresholds used.

- **Cross-dataset integration:** Notably, Nichols' dataset was a driving use-case for OMP. By aligning our annotation with OMP and using consistent ECO evidence codes, we can integrate our database with external resources like OMPwiki or cross-reference studies. It also sets us up to incorporate future data (like CRISPR-based essentiality screens, which OMP also covers and would use different ECO codes).

- **Confidence in approach:** Using OMP, MCO, and ECO together is a long-term investment in data quality. We might encounter a learning curve, but the consistency and integration benefits are extremely high. We have high confidence (9-10/10) that this will improve our ontology annotation process and the utility of the dataset in a database context.

## File: ANL-SDL-48EcoliPhenos.xlsx

### Data Structure Summary

- **Sheets & Purpose:** This Excel file contains phenotype data for 48 *E. coli* environmental isolates tested on various substrates. The sheets are somewhat confusingly named (Sheet1, Sheet2, etc.), but based on content: **Sheet1** appears to list isolate identifiers (tube labels) and a "Genome ID" for each (likely an internal or NCBI genome reference number). **Sheet2** is the main data matrix of phenotypes (substrate utilization results). Sheets **Sheet3** and **Sheet4** seem to be intermediate data (possibly raw readings or a transposed view of the matrix with some calculated stats like max/min), and **Sheet5** was empty (perhaps a placeholder).

- **Key Columns:** In Sheet2 (primary data), the first column "Genome" contains an identifier like 562.61239, which looks like a taxonomy ID followed by a strain-specific suffix (562 is the NCBI Taxon ID for E. coli; the number after the dot could be an isolate index or Genome ID in a database). The remaining columns are names of carbon sources or other growth substrates: e.g. *Salicin*, *Raffinose*, *Î±-Lactose*, *D-Glucose*, *D-Fructose*, *Cellobiose*, *D-Galacturonic_Acid*, ... up to *L-Malic Acid*. There are 29 such substrate columns in total. The cell values are mostly 1 or 0 (with a few cells possibly blank if not tested). A 1 indicates the isolate **grew** on that substrate (positive utilization), while 0 indicates **no growth** on that substrate. This is essentially a binary phenotypic profile for each strain on each carbon source.

- **Data Types & Patterns:** The data is binary qualitative results, likely derived from growth tests (e.g. a Biolog Phenotype MicroArray or simple OD growth curve endpoint). It's likely thresholded from raw values. Sheets3 and 4 support this: they list "Isolate Number (Tube Label)" across columns (with numbers like 3.0, 19.0, 30.0, etc., presumably corresponding to the tube labels of the 48 isolates), and rows labeled "Carbon Source" with numeric entries. It looks like Sheet3/4 contain the actual measured values (e.g. optical density or metabolic signal) for each isolate on each substrate, and perhaps two replicates or conditions (Sheet3 vs Sheet4). The presence of "Max" and "Min" columns in Sheet3 suggests that for each substrate, they recorded the maximum and minimum readings across the isolates, likely to help set the cutoff for calling 1 vs 0. Sheet2 then is the processed binary table derived from those measurements (Sheet5 being empty indicates the processing might have been done externally or Sheet2 was manually curated). Overall, the structure is one isolate per row, one substrate per column, in a typical strain-phenotype matrix.

### Microbial Data Analysis

- **Phenotypes/Trait Types:** The phenotypes here are **carbon source utilization abilities** of different E. coli strains. Essentially, for each isolate, we have a profile of which carbon sources it can use as the sole carbon source for growth. This is a classic set of metabolic phenotypes:
  - If a column is 1 for an isolate, it means that strain can metabolize that compound to support growth (i.e. has the necessary transport and enzymatic pathway).
  - If 0, the strain cannot effectively use that compound, likely due to missing genes in that pathway or regulatory differences.
  
  All the substrates listed are organic compounds, many of them sugars or sugar derivatives, indicating these tests targeted carbohydrate metabolism pathways.

- **Example Data by Category:** The substrates can be grouped:
  - **Common sugars:** *D-Glucose* (baseline sugar, most if not all isolates likely 1), *D-Fructose*, *Maltose*, *Melibiose* (galactose + glucose disaccharide), *Raffinose* (a trisaccharide), *Stachyose* (tetrasaccharide). Many isolates have 1 on these, but some traditional lab strains can't use e.g. raffinose without specific genes, and environmental isolates might vary.
  - **Î²-linked sugars:** *Cellobiose* (glucose dimer), *Salicin* (a glycoside), *D-Lactose (Î±-Lactose)* -- these require specific Î²-glucosidases. If some isolates have 0 for Salicin or Cellobiose, they likely lack the *bgl* operon or similar functions.
  - **Sugar alcohols and polyols:** *D-Mannitol*, *D-Sorbitol*, *D-Arabitol*, *Inosine* (a nucleoside that can serve as carbon source for some bacteria), *Glycerol*. E. coli K-12 can use mannitol and sorbitol (with appropriate transporters), but some strains might have lost that or require activation. In the snippet, all three example isolates had 0 for D-Arabitol and D-Sorbitol, suggesting those might be more niche substrates.
  - **Uronic acids and derivatives:** *D-Glucuronic_Acid*, *D-Galacturonic_Acid*, *Pectin*. These relate to metabolism of plant polysaccharides. Many lab strains can't degrade pectin (complex polymer), and might not utilize galacturonate unless they have the *uxa/uxu* pathway active. Indeed, in the sample, all shown isolates had 0 for D-Galacturonic_Acid and Pectin.
  - **Organic acids:** *Succinic Acid*, *L-Malic Acid*, *Glutaric Acid*, *Acetoacetic Acid (Methyl acetoacetate)*, *Lactate (Lactic acid)*. E. coli typically can use TCA cycle acids (malate, succinate) but perhaps some isolates have differences. The snippet indicates variation in L-Malic (some 0, some 1). *Acetoacetic acid* utilization might vary depending on if they can convert it (it's a ketone body).
  - **Rare sugars/amines:** *L-Rhamnose* (a deoxysugar, E. coli K-12 can use rhamnose via rha genes), *N-Acetyl Neuraminic Acid* (sialic acid -- only some E. coli, usually pathogens, can catabolize sialic acid via *nan* genes). Likely many environmental isolates can use sialic acid if they come from gut environments; a soil isolate might not have that ability. In the snippet all three examples had 1 for N-Acetyl Neuraminic Acid, which is interesting -- perhaps these isolates are from fecal sources and retained the nan operon.

- **Data Quality Observations:** The binary calls likely simplify what might be gradual differences (some strains might grow weakly -- borderline OD). Because a min-max threshold method seems to have been used (taking max and min per substrate), the quality is dependent on picking a good cutoff. There might be a few false negatives (strains that grow a bit but got a 0) or false positives (noise mis-read as growth). However, given 48 isolates, one can often clearly see bimodal distributions per substrate (either most grow robustly or none do). The presence of max/min suggests some normalization might have been done. Overall, the data provides a clear phenotypic fingerprint for each isolate, suitable for comparing their metabolic capabilities.

- **Taxonomic/Strain Info:** All isolates are *Escherichia coli*, but they are environmental strains (perhaps from various sources like soil, water, etc., collected by "Aaron's Lab" as per sheet1 title). The "Genome ID" likely corresponds to a sequence or taxonomy reference in a database (possibly NCBI Genome or an Argonne database). There may be slight genetic diversity among them (they might belong to different E. coli lineages). No explicit taxonomy beyond species is given in the sheet, but the genome IDs hint at entries (like 562.61143 might correspond to NCBI BioSample or JGI genome IDs).

- **Cross-Isolate Trends:** We can infer some relationships: If two isolates have very similar patterns of 1/0 across 29 substrates, they might be related or from similar niches. If one isolate is missing multiple capabilities (e.g. isolate with many zeros might be a more specialized strain), that could indicate an evolutionary trade-off (loss of functions in exchange for something else). Also, the set of substrates not utilized by a strain can indicate gene absence: e.g. an isolate that is 0 for all Î²-glucosides (salicin, cellobiose, arbutin if tested) likely lacks the bgl genes. This dataset could thus be used to correlate genotype (from genome sequencing) with phenotype via presence/absence of pathways.
